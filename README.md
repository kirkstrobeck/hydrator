# Hydrator ðŸŽˆ

### Reduce bundle size by pruning unnecessary hydrations

Get all the benefits of building in React without the processing and bundle size burdens of redundant hydration. In other words, React doesnâ€™t need to control everything.

For example, if you have a component that generates your nav and that nav wonâ€™t change based on props or state, then it shouldnâ€™t be JS on the client. It can be JS when rendering on the server and HTML/CSS when shipped.

## How does it work?

Server-side rendering remains unchanged. However, the client-side hydration bundle is limited to specific DOM entry points.

Use `hydrator` to specify hydration areas. Any area that is unspecified will not ship to the client and will not hydrate; it will merely be HTML/CSS.

## What does this mean?

- It means you donâ€™t need a complicated templating approach. You can use React everywhere and not pay the penalty.
- It is an opportunity to think thru interaction points that have the same or nearly the same functionality with an HTML/CSS approach â€” for example, a CSS drop-down menu or a hidden checkbox that toggles a visual state.
